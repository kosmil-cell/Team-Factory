This Privacy Policy describes how the Team Factory - Pokémon Builder app ("the App", "we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use it.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do **not** require you to create an account, sign in, or provide your name, email address, or other contact details to use the App.

However, some limited data is collected or processed as part of providing core functionality, understanding how the App is used, and improving its stability.

### 1.1. Usage Data (Firebase Analytics)

We use **Firebase Analytics** (a service provided by Google/Firebase) to collect anonymous usage data about how the App is used. This helps us understand which features are used, how often, and where users may encounter issues or friction.

Firebase Analytics may collect information such as:

- Events and actions in the App (e.g., which screens are viewed, which features are used)
- Basic device information (e.g., device model, operating system version, language)
- Approximate location (based on IP, where enabled by Google)
- App version and installation information

We use this data in aggregated form to:

- Understand how users interact with the App
- Improve features and user experience
- Prioritize bug fixes and enhancements

We do **not** use Firebase Analytics for advertising or cross-app tracking.

### 1.2. Crash Reports (Firebase Crashlytics)

When the App crashes or encounters certain errors, we use **Firebase Crashlytics** to collect crash reports. This helps us find and fix bugs.

Crash reports may include:

- Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version)
- App version you are using
- Time and type of crash
- Technical details about the error (stack trace)

We use this information **only** to improve the stability and performance of the App.

### 1.3. Anonymous Feedback / Suggestions

Inside the App, there is a text box where you can optionally submit **anonymous suggestions or feedback**. When you send a suggestion, the text is stored in **Firebase** (our backend service).

- We do not ask you for your name, email, or other identifying information.
- Please do **not** include personal information in your suggestion text.

We use this data solely to understand how to improve the App.

### 1.4. Image Processing

The App allows you to select images (for example, screenshots of your Pokémon stats) from your device’s existing photos. These images are:

- Processed **locally on your device** only
- **Not uploaded** to our servers
- **Not sent** to third parties by the App

We do not store or collect copies of your images.

## 2. How We Use the Information

We use the information described above for the following purposes:

- To understand how the App is used (Firebase Analytics)
- To diagnose crashes and technical issues (Firebase Crashlytics)
- To improve the stability, performance, and user experience of the App
- To understand feature requests and feedback via anonymous suggestions

We do **not** sell your data. 
We do **not** use your data for advertising or cross-app tracking.

---

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

### 3.1. Firebase (Google)

We use Firebase services provided by Google LLC, including:

- **Firebase Analytics** – for anonymous usage analytics
- **Firebase Crashlytics** – for crash reporting
- **Firebase (database / backend)** – to store anonymous suggestions

These services may process data as described in their own privacy policies. For more details, please see:

- Firebase Privacy & Security: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy 
- Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

### 3.2. Cloudflare (Content Delivery / Hosting)

We use Cloudflare, Inc. to deliver downloadable content (e.g., files/assets) to your device via a content delivery network (CDN) / hosting. When you download content, Cloudflare may process network and technical data (such as your IP address, user-agent/device and browser information, and request logs) to provide content delivery, performance, and security (e.g., DDoS protection).

## 4. Data Retention

- Analytics data and crash reports are retained by Firebase for a period determined by their standard policies and settings. We use them to understand usage patterns and fix bugs.
- Anonymous suggestions may be stored for as long as reasonably necessary to review feedback and improve the App.

If you would like specific feedback or content to be removed and you believe it can be reasonably identified, you can contact us (see Contact section below).

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is **not specifically designed for children**, but it also does not require any personal information or account creation.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information through suggestions or other means, please contact us so we can remove it.

---

## 6. External Links

The App may include buttons or links that open external websites or services, such as **Pokémon Showdown**.

These external websites are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party sites. We recommend that you review their privacy policies separately.

---

## 7. Security

We take reasonable technical measures to protect the data we process and store (for example, by using trusted services such as Firebase and secure connections where applicable).

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 8. Your Choices

Since we do not collect contact information or create user accounts, we cannot always identify individual users.

However, where applicable, you may:

- Limit certain types of data collection by adjusting device-level settings (for example, ad personalization or analytics settings provided by Google/Android).
- Avoid sending suggestions if you do not wish for any text content to be stored.

If you have specific concerns about data related to your use of the App, you can contact us (see Contact section) and we will do our best to help, within what is technically feasible.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example when we add new features or change services.

When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We recommend that you review this page periodically for any updates.
